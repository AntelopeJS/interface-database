# interface-database

AQL, the AntelopeJS database query builder, published as `@antelopejs/interface-database`. It declares the contract; database modules such as `@antelopejs/mongodb`, `@antelopejs/postgres` and `@antelopejs/rethinkdb` implement it.

## Layout

- `src/` holds the runtime entry points. `index.ts` is the root export and re-exports `errors.ts`; every other top-level module, and `staged-query/`, is a subpath listed in both `exports` and `typesVersions` in `package.json`. A new subpath needs an entry in both. `antelope.test.ts` is the test project, not a subpath.
- `src/staged-query/` is the build-only entry point. It must not import `@antelopejs/interface-core` or `node:async_hooks`; `scripts/test-staged-query.cjs` enforces that against `dist`.
- `src/tests/` is the conformance suite. It compiles to `dist/tests` and ships in the package, and the database modules run it against their driver, so a change there changes what every implementer must pass. `datasets/` and `helpers/` are its fixtures.
- `skills/` and `docs/` ship in the package. `docs/` is the source of interfaces.antelopejs.com/docs/database, and its code samples typecheck through `docs/tsconfig.json`, which maps the package onto `src`.

## Versioning

- Database modules cap their range below the next minor of this package, for example `>=0.1.11 <0.2.0`. When a change adds something they must implement, list it under `### Upgrade notes` in `CHANGELOG.md`, with the module versions that honour it.
- The release commit writes `CHANGELOG.md`. Upgrade notes follow in a separate `docs(changelog)` pull request.

## Tests

- `pnpm test` builds, then runs `ajs module test .` with `src/antelope.test.ts`: it starts an in-memory MongoDB 8.0.8 replica set and runs `dist/tests` through `@antelopejs/mongodb` 1.6.0, a devDependency loaded as a local module. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` overrides the `@antelopejs/interface-database` dependency of `@antelopejs/mongodb` with a link to this package, and the suites import the code under test by relative path, so they exercise the local build: without the override they would run the published copy the implementer installs. Do not import `@antelopejs/interface-database` by name in a suite. The first run downloads the MongoDB binary.
- `pnpm run checks` does not run the docs check (links and type-checked samples in `README.md` and `docs/`); only CI runs it, through the `docs-files` input of `ci.yml`.
- `pnpm run checks` and CI do not run `pnpm test:staged-query`, the isolation and parity test of the build-only entry point. Run it when you change `src/staged-query/`.

## Guardrails

Finish every change with `pnpm run checks`. It runs typecheck, lint, format, knip, tests, size, suppressions, and sync, and prints only what failed. The change is done when it prints no failure.

The tools enforce most rules, listed in the table at the end. The sections below hold the rules no tool checks.

### Comments

Say it in code. A constraint belongs in a type, a lint rule, or a test. A public item's contract belongs in TSDoc (`/** */`) on that item. The only other comments are lint directives that name their rules, `@ts-expect-error <reason>`, `SAFETY: <reason>` above a type assertion, `/*!` license headers, and bundler or formatter directives.

Before suppressing a type rule, try inference or a type derived from its owner with `Parameters`, `ReturnType`, or indexed access. A private alias can still appear in a published declaration. Keep a suppression only after checking the published contract and the unchecked boundary it protects.

Check each directive reason against the current line and its callers. Returning a value is not the same as awaiting and discarding it. A reason must describe what the code does now.

### Tests

Hold every test you write or keep to this checklist:

- Name the wrong implementation this test fails on. A test with no answer is deleted, not kept.
- No test reads the file it tests. Drive the behaviour through the public interface.
- An invariant over many files is a lint rule, not a test.

### Cleanup proof

A behaviour-preserving cleanup PR shows `antelopejs-api-diff <base-ref>` passing. Published declarations, built runtime exports and the names and signatures a DMS frontend module auto-imports stay unchanged; pass `--allow-added <glob>` (repeatable, e.g. `'**/internal/**'`) to let added entries under that glob pass when their module is `@internal`, and copy its "Added (allowed)" list. Every export under a directory that `dms.frontend.build.ts` auto-imports is published, `@internal` or not; a helper that must stay private goes under `app/build/`. A comment-only PR shows `antelopejs-comment-proof <base-ref>` passing instead of a verifier. Both compare committed HEAD.

Copy the proof's whole output into the PR body, down to its closing `<!-- antelopejs-proof ... -->` line, which stamps the command, base, committed head and a digest. Never type counts by hand. List the lint findings a PR leaves in place by pasting the block `antelopejs-body-check --findings` prints and replacing each `<why>`. `antelopejs-body-check <body.md>` fails an edited or stale proof block, proof output outside one, and a findings line that is not a live diagnostic at HEAD; counts in prose are not checked, so leave them out. The table counts a lint directive once per rule it names, inline directives included.

Pass `--probe <file.cjs>` to api-diff when changing receivers, positional calls, or modules that no published entry reaches. The same captured script runs against both worktree roots, supplied as `argv[2]`, and prints JSON observations. Matching metadata alone does not prove those behaviours.

An entry-only rule exempts only its own module. Add a second module entry rather than exempting another importer. A no-upward rule must reject peers in the same tier as well as higher tiers. Probe the rank decision with an import, not just a reading of the configuration.

Moving a method body into a function keeps how it is called: the same receiver, argument count, read order and laziness.

Verify a boundary against the imports a developer or agent would plausibly write: static and dynamic imports, re-exports, Vue `src`, CSS `@import`, and worker or child-process entries in normally named files. A construction only an evasion would write, an edit to resolution configuration (`package.json` `browser`, `exports`, `main` or `imports`, bundler aliases, tsconfig `paths`), and a difference observable only by patching private fields or internal methods go under Attention and never block. Public API and ordinary subclass behaviour stay part of the contract.

### Suppression budget

`guardrails.suppressions.json` caps the suppressions in authored code: lint directives per rule they name (`*` for none), `@ts-expect-error`, `@ts-ignore` and `SAFETY:` comments, and under `config` each rule a lint config (`oxlint.config.*`, `.oxlintrc.json`, `eslint.config.*`) switches off or to a warning, keyed by rule and `files` glob anchored at the config's directory, so widening or moving a scope is a new ceiling of 0, while narrowing one takes over the room it gives up. Switching a rule off in a config is a suppression too: fix the code its rule reports instead. A suppression over its ceiling fails: fix the code, or remove another suppression of the same kind. A rule that keeps needing suppressions should be changed in the preset. Never raise or remove a number in that file: the check fails a ceiling higher than on the pull request base, and only the operator approves a raise. A directive disabling `anti-slop/require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion` is burn-down debt: remove the assertion, or, where it holds, replace the directive with `SAFETY: <why it holds>`, which takes over its room without a raise. After you remove suppressions, run `pnpm run suppressions:update` and commit the lowered file.
