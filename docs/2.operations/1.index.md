# Operations

This section covers the various operations you can perform with the AQL interface. These operations allow you to manage databases, tables, documents, and indexes, as well as perform queries and transformations on your data.

## Database Operations

AQL provides top-level functions for database management:

- [2. Database Management](./2.database_management.md) - Creating, listing, and deleting databases

## Table Operations

Tables are the primary container for your data:

- [3. Table Operations](./3.table_operations.md) - Creating, listing, and dropping tables

## Document Operations

Documents are the basic unit of data in AQL:

- [4. CRUD Operations](./4.crud.md) - Create, read, update, and delete documents

## Index Operations

Indexes accelerate queries and enable efficient lookups:

- [5. Indexes](./5.indexes.md) - Creating, listing, and using indexes

## Query Operations

Queries allow you to filter, transform, and aggregate data:

- [6. Filtering and Querying](./6.filtering.md) - Filtering documents and querying data

## Next Steps
